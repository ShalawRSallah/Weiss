I live about 15 miles from where this happened and my town has severely flooded a couple times over the past 15 years.  The Watch and Warning system needs to be changed or elevated to a higher level. I can tell you when most people around here see a flash flood watch or flash flood warning it is not taken very seriously.  We see them all the time.  Almost anytime it rains around here the National Weather service issues a Flash Flood Watch or Warning.  Most cases it never floods.  It&#39;s kind of like the little boy who cried wolf.  I just think someone needs to take a serious look at how we can give a better and more urgent warning when these situations arise.  Maybe we can prevent loss of life like this in the future.\\n","time":"2015-05-26","title":"","source":"gma.yahoo.com","rating":-1,"eid":"ead46d30-9cad-3d89-b565-1e70ccdef5eb"},{"author":"TJ1988","body":"This needs to be a wake up call for anyone that lives near a river or creek or a low lying area.

I wish I had the means to do something to help the victims of this terrible event.<br \\/>\\nI know that in my area we were for many years in danger of flash floods and there is a long history of such events occurring as well as mudslides, often resulting in a tragic loss of life. Quite a while ago efforts to build drainage and to direct water runoff into spillways were made at great expense, but many homes and lives have been saved as a result.  Still, we have flash flood warnings in some areas because we are so close to the foothills and mountains, and STILL, people go camping in danger zones, build homes in canyons that are sometimes treacherous traps, and do foolish things because they seem to think themselves as not the mortals they are. If by any words that I can say, it helps someone stop and take stock of a desire to jeopardize themselves and their families with regard to warnings, and heeds those warnings staying out of harms way, then great.  If they don&#39;t, i can only hope the best for them and that they use more wisdom as a motivating force than desire for comforts or pleasures.

That is all it took. we were stuck in the upstairs of our home. It did not lift off its foundation and float away. We were rescued by workers and lowered to boats and then taken out. Red cross put us into hotels. We had nothing but the clothes on our backs (which were pajamas). We did not even have shoes. Everything was lost once we were able to get back in the home due to the mold that grew very fast on everything. My heart goes out to these people. They do not understand that power of flood waters or of moving river water. Our front door was pushed in and the sliding glass door on the back was forced out. WE were on the stairs when it crashed thru the house and destroyed the furniture in its path. The candle that was on the coffee table when the flood waters receded had landed and sat on top of the mud covered toilet in our half bathroom.

Some people may appear to be more sinful(e.g. lie, steal, murder, unforgiveness, etc.) than others, but we are all born with a rebellious nature towards Yahweh and should not compare ourselves among ourselves concerning sin. Romans 3:23 states: &quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of Yahweh.&quot; Yeshua(Jesus) teaches that just desiring in your heart to commit sin is against Yahweh&#39;s Torah(Teaching), which emphasizes &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The Bible warns in Revelation 20:11-15 that if you reject Yahweh&#39;s plan of salvation you will not enter into His Kingdom. That&#39;s not Yahweh&#39;s desire. 2 Peter 3:9 states: &quot;The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.&quot; He sent His Son Yeshua Who lived a sinless life and willingly suffered and died on the cross for you. You broke Yahweh&#39;s Torah, but Yeshua paid your fine. That means He can legally dismiss your case. He can commute your &quot;second death&quot; sentence. In John 3:16-17 Yeshua says, &quot;For Yahweh so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For Yahweh did not send His Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it.&quot; Then He rose from the dead and defeated death. Please repent (turn from sin) today and trust alone in Yeshua, and Yahweh will grant you the gift of everlasting life. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. In Revelation 21:4 Yahweh promises His people that in His Kingdom &quot;there will be no more death, mourning, crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&quot; There is nothing more important than your eternal salvation!\\n","time":"2015-05-26","title":"","source":"gma.yahoo.com","rating":-1,"eid":"1e76d74a-9077-34d0-9876-ecdac55b44d7"},{"author":"Steve","body":"I would not call 62% &quot;resounding&quot;.

What happened was this: People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn\\u2019t treat him like God, refusing to worship him, they trivialized themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate regarding life.
