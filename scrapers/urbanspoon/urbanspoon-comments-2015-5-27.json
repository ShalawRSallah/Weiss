However, to get a reservation at a 5:30 I had to make it 4 weeks out. We were about 20 minutes early so we checked in and told the hostess that we were going to be at the bar to get a drink, until our table was ready. My wife was exited to check out the Bloody Mary Bar for $5.00, that we\u2019ve heard so much about. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that the bloody Mary bar is only for lunch, but he could make her one. So a Bloody Mary and a Jack and Coke came to $22.00 plus tip. Ouch! That was a bit more than we were expecting but we were out on the town and just wanted to have a good time and enjoy ourselves. So 5:30 came and went and we still didn\u2019t get a table. So about 5:45 I went back out to the hostess stand and asked about our 5:30 reservation. They told me it would be another few minutes. So we finally get a seat right next to the corner of the bar. The problem is that it was so narrow between the bar and my chair every time somebody went by they would bump into my chair or me. So I asked out waiter if we could move over one table. He did allow us, so that was good. So my wife is sitting against the wall on like a big long velour couch and I was sitting in a velour chair across from her. She was complaining how uncomfortable she was, and so was I at this point. Both of our seats felt like the springs were blown out and we were sitting in a hole. The velour upholstery was all stained up and looked filthy. The mirrors on the wall looked filthy at first, but then I realized they were just old pitted. With all of the high ratings, despite the tiny tables, I was expecting better. So as an appetizer we ordered the bone marrow and mushroom risotto. Both were very good I must say. For our main course I ordered the Hudson Valley Duck Breast and my wife ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. We both ordered them medium rare as recommended by our waiter. My Duck breast was very chewy and gristly, even after I trimmed off what looked fat and gristle. I couldn\u2019t even find a piece that I didn\u2019t have to spit out after a few minutes of chewing. My wife gave me some of her Wagyu Flat Iron to eat instead. It wasn\u2019t bad but defiantly didn\u2019t seem like Wagyu beef. I didn\u2019t complain though, I just wanted to get out of the uncomfortable chair I was sitting in and go home. Our waiter asked what was wrong with my dinner because I obviously didn\u2019t eat it. So I told him it was very chewy and gristly. He said that was one their signature dishes and after talking to his manager, he took my dinner off of our check. The service from our waiter was good so he got a nice tip, but as for the restaurant, we were very disappointed.\n", "rating": -1, "title": "Disappointing Experience", "author": "John", "source": "urbanspoon", "time": "1427367983", "id": "1595486"}, {"body": "\nCreative genius in regards to all facets of this restaurant.

We arrived close to 10pm on a Monday night, place was bustling, very loud (DJ spinning tunes in the corner, luckily in my age group), full of the pretty people here to see and be seen. A large bar hogs up most of the main room, a circular dining area rings it. Place is dimly lit, beautiful dark wood and cast iron, marble and mirrors, like a 19th century parlor. We were seated towards the end of the bar at an unfortunate turn in the dining room. Overflow from the bar made passage pretty tight. Dimwit hostess tried to seat another group between us, either she gave up trying to make me move into oncoming traffic or the incoming guests decided (wisely to ask for another table). The place pretty much filled to the gills, then I realized, duh, Monday night late menu special \"Night Cap\" (starts at 10pm). Cocktails, Prohibition-era, were the best of the night (this was stop #6 on a self-guided restaurant crawl of downtown Pittsburgh). My friend had the 25th Hour (subbed vodka), I had the Southie; both made great use of herb and spice liqueurs for subtle accents. Since I knew we were headed this way, saved myself for the Bone Marrow. An enormous tray arrive with 2 large marrow bones split in half and stacked. Accoutrements were classic and perfectly matched to cut the unctuousness of the marrow (pickled onion, parsley, sea salt, capers). We devoured the top two, they were phenomenal. The bottom two were unfortunately cold (as much of a carnivore as I am, cold marrow is totally gross). Also had the Devils on Horseback, jumbo Medjool dates stuffed with chorizo, wrapped with bacon and broiled. Very tasty, touch overwhelming on the dates for me (maybe use a smaller date?). The menu is not, shall we say, \"lite\", but hey, you didn't expect that from a place called \"Meat and Potatoes\" did you.

Regardless of our lack of variety in ordering, the sandwich was pretty killer.

I bucket this place in a category like Green Forest Churrascaria, but better. Where Green Forest is an expensive dinner of $40+ with similar food, but all-you-can-eat, Gaucho gives you a focused taste. You don't need to spend $40 to eat steak done 10 ways when you can drop $12 on a sandwich with steak cooked perfectly, with fantastic toppings, and nicely portioned.

More eggplant would have been nice.Also good were the spicy green beens, actually the least spicy of all despite the name but the beans were too crunchy.

Tacos, people, by their very definition are fast food. I don't care how flipping tasty they may be.

We went early on purpose so we wouldn't wreck anyone else's evening out with cranky kids. But even I was cranky after 45 minutes of waiting for our food with no munchies to snack on. I had to go find our server to ask for my son's chicken taco - he was starving! Again, these are tacos you're making folks not cassoulet. If you only want college students, childless yuppies, and hipsters dining at your restaurant then keep up the good work. If you don't want kids there, that's honestly fine, just be straight and tell parents when they walk in that they'll have to wait an hour for a single taco and they will surely turn around and walk out. I hate writing bad reviews and I love seeing new and interesting restaurants in my beloved Pittsburgh but give me a freaking break.

I tried three kinds of tacos: brisket, pulled pork, and chicken. They all immediately rank among the best tacos I've ever had. The meat in each is carefully and perfectly cooked. The juiciness and flavor is so profound that no cheese or fixings is needed. And the tortilla is...perfect. The brisket and pulled pork were both delicious. The latter featured a few big, thick strips of tender pork, not the tong-full of pork soup that usually goes into tacos and burritos. (which I enjoy very much, don't get me wrong) But what really knocked my proverbial socks off (Proverbs 4:18.. \"Yay, and he who shall taste the Taco, shall thus have his slippers shot forth from his feet\") was the chicken taco. The best chicken taco (or burrito) I've ever eaten...easily. Hell, I don't even really know what was on it, but it was remarkable.Secondary good points.. the interior is funky and charming. They have old doors re-purposed to support the counter; I thought that was kinda cool. The pretty gal (owner?) at the counter was super friendly. Ok, let's go negative for minute.I ordered three tacos. It took 35 minutes. Seriously. I'd read that the service was slow, but I still have to figure this is an aberration. I loved the food so much, I wanted to leave the place with only raves. But the more I thought about it, it's pretty crazy that it took that long. There was only one table of four before me. And despite all her helpfulness and friendliness, the lady never said a thing about it taking so long. Oh, and there's no AC. A long wait only seems longer on a hot day like yesterday.As good as it was...and it was....my 3 tacos and a drink came to about $14. And they aren't very big. I can attach several kind terms to Smoke, but \"Good Value\" isn't one of them.I will most definitely be back. The food is too good to boycott the place just because I had to wait too long my first time. Oh, and pictures of their food really don't do it any favors. It just looks like meat on a tortilla.

Instead of a big breakfast meal I had to order everything separate which ended up costing me $30 just for my own meal. A bit pricey but still I enjoyed it. As for the title of my review, the first time I went to Central Diner I was literally two bites into my meal when the waitress came over and asked if I wanted to take the rest home. She had to of been the most ignorant waitress I have ever encountered, and I am a pleasant customer and to top it off I tip at least 30%, but not to a server who has an attitude and gives poor performance for no foreseeable reason. I used to be a busser, waiter and bar tender so I know service and do not expect the world. I even clean up after myself to help the staff, I stack all the dishes to make whoever cleans my table job easier, again I used to do the job so I know what it's like. My second visit, yes I went back after experiencing the waitress from hell, my server was not ignorant like the first, but she never smiled, never asked if I wanted a refill, as a matter of fact she never said a whole sentence. She came to my table said \"what can I get you\" and that was the only time she spoke. After that I have not went back. I read the review of the owner yelling at the staff, in my opinion, if he was yelling at either one of the servers I had, he should do it more often. I know the industry, I know all too well what it is like to deal with the public, the 'service' I received on both trips to Central Diner, the second trip was poor, but the first was down right ignorant and inexcusable. A tip to all servers out there:: I know not every customer tips, I know some customers are ignorant, but there are those customers like myself that are always pleasant and tip VERY well, so you have no one but yourself to blame when I leave a single dollar or even a single penny as your tip to show you what a lousy job you have done. Earn it, which is extremely easy to do because I do not expect much, or find another job because when I go out to eat I expect to have a pleasant time, not deal with your attitude and poor service, if that's the case I can serve myself and tip myself.\n", "rating": -1, "title": "Depends on the server", "author": "bktacy", "source": "urbanspoon", "time": "1432657568", "id": "1674640"}, {"body": "\nAfter reading all the great reviews, this was the place for mothers day.

We ordered a steak salad (which is why we came, we've had them before) and a portobello sandwich. The steak salad came missing 1/2 of the stuff that's supposed to be on it, with burned-up, bad quality Steakums-like meat on it, on a bed of wilted iceberg lettuce. The sandwich wasn't bad, but was cold and swimming in sauce. I sent the salad back and said overall we were very unhappy with the food (which I have NEVER done in my life.)

I think it used to be a Chinese restaurant.The food is burgers.. you can order a few choices off the menu or you can build your own...from bun to beef to cheese to toppings, etc...you order a \"build your own\" via a checklist ala Bahama Mama (a restaurant in the Bank Center downtown - who remembers THAT??) I opted for the hormone free beef (vs. the more expensive wagyu beef), angel dust rub (salt pepper garlic), cracked peppercorn rub, cheddar horseradish cheese and some type of aioli sauce. SHAZAM! You can also choose RED, PINK or Medium for cooking style. I choose RED of course! My kid Meg ordered hers pink. Girl after my own heart. The burger was awesome. The beef was high quality, the rubs were perfect, and the whole thing was a great, fresh, juicy, scrumptious mess! The bugers came with chips - both tater and sweet tater. They were good - no better or no worse than others. The fries were good... salted and herbed. Shoestrings...run of the mill. As far as I'm concerned 5 Guys has the best fries around - these don't even come close. The onion rings were good, and huge and almost as $$ as the burger. I don't get that, but they were good.For dessert Meg and I had one of their shakes. Whatever. It was good. Mine was Salted Nutella and hers was S'mores.. Let's be honest..I don't believe there is any way to really elevate a shake by using chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Mine had nutella - so what. Hers had chunks of ground up graham crackers. They were as good as any Dairy Queen Blizzard. They were 5 bucks for a large. Keep in mind Blizzards are 5 bucks too - so they are not all they expensive. They were good...to die for??

There is a little bit of deception here, in the naming of this fantastic place. While they do handmake noodles, and the noodles are fantastic, there is something far greater on the menu that will make your dreams come true.Soup Dumplings. I had once seen this on an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, when he was in China. Imagine a steamed dumpling. Enclosed within a thin, fragile steamed dumpling, if you can fathom this, is broth, meat, and vegetables. You hold one in your cute spoon. You think, \"is this going to burn my mouth?\" They tell you to poke a hole to let out the steam, or nibble a hole into the side. Regardless of how you vent the initial steam, you should. Then, you drop a little dumpling sauce (mild, not very salty, soy-type sauce) into the dumpling, and stick the whole damn thing into your mouth.What happens next is one of the great things about living. Any anger or pain you had at the time dissipates. An unbelievable explosion of flavors occurs. The warm broth fills your mouth and taste buds, and then you get the tender meat, and the hint of dumpling sauce that you just added. My first thought was \"oh damn, we only ordered 8 of these.\" I have dreams of soup dumplings stacked to the ceiling. Whatever you do, order a lot of these. They will not disappoint you. While the other food items are very good as well, you will wish you had more soup dumplings in place of the other food items. Screw variety, who needs it? When you find something you love, eat it a bajillion times.I speak very much of Opportunity Cost here, because we did order 3 other items. We tried the Pork and Vegetable Potstickers, which were also very delicious. I would definitely order that one again, and have 1 potsticker between every 8 soup dumpings I consume. We also got the Sesame Cold Noodles and Hot & Spicy Wonton Noodles. Out of the two, I liked the cold noodles better. You can really taste how fresh the noodles are.

We were greeted immediately upon walking in and The hostess seating us gave a very good overview of the menu, filled our water glasses, and left the carafe on the table (which I always like).

Having worked in food service before, I'm very understanding and wasn't bothered by this as I've had the same issue. She took our drink order and those were promptly brought to our table (I had the Boulder Mojo a nitro IPA and my boyfriend had an Old Brown Ale). They have a decent draft selection-lots of IPAs which I love. Most are between $5.50-$7 so typical Pittsburgh prices. We started off with the buffalo fried chicken balls with blue cheese and celery. The celery was shredded and blended with the blue cheese which topped the fried chicken balls. They were delicious-had a definite kick to them-and there were 6 balls so it was perfect for sharing. For our entrees we both decided to do 2 sliders (since you can't do multiple types of meatballs in any of the serving options-that was my one negative). We both did a meatball of the day slider. The meatball of the day was a ground beef/corned beef mix topped with saurkraut and stone ground mustard. WOW! It was perfectly pink in the middle-how I like it-and the flavors blended together perfectly! My boyfriend chose a spicy pork slider with Arribiatta sauce which he said was very good. I chose a chicken meatball with the tzatziki sauce and again-WOW! The tzatziki sauce was probably the best I've ever had and I really liked the flavors in the chicken meatball. After that hiccup in the beginning, service was great-we were checked on at exactly the right points during our visit, our glasses were always full, after we finished the plates were immediately cleared.

The monthly vegetarian dinner is what initially brought me to Kaya when I lived out in the South Hills, and the regular menu and expansive drink selection kept bringing me back through the years.\n", "rating": -1, "title": "Beers, brunch, and bloodys", "author": "Cassie Kay", "source": "urbanspoon", "time": "1390977608", "id": "270900"}, {"body": "\nHaven't been in over 15 years. Husband didn't think he would like it. Turns out we both loved it. Delicious fish tacos, maybe even better than Mad Mex.

I was so excited to try Kaya, but could've done without the mediocre food and terrible service. Drinks and dinner for a party of 4 took nearly two hours, most of the time spent waiting for another round (we each only got two drinks because it was so slow) and waiting for our check. I honestly have nothing to say about the food, other than it's overpriced. When we finally got the check and saw Kaya is part of the Big Burrito restaurant group, I wasn't surprised at the bad service.

Had dinner there last night. We arrived with our reservation at about 6:50 PM. We we seated promptly and given menus. One waitress gave us water and said someone would take our drink orders soon. Our waitress (Meagan) came and took our drink orders. She was cordial and said \"Would you like to know what's on my menu?\" To which I responded \"Is your menu different from this menu?\" She seemed somewhat intrigued and responded \"kind if\". We then heard the specials and nightly changes to the menu. We ordered the jerk chicken wings and ceviche. Both appetizers came quite promptly and were put on our table along with our drinks (microbrew beer and a Cosmo - well brand us Absolute). We sat there for at least 5 minutes before we could get our waitress' attention to bring us plates. Then we ordered main courses. I had grilled Salmon which was nicely cooked as desired. However underneath the Salmon were some sort of smashed oval home fries. The fries tasted like they were a day old and warmed up. The first Cosmo came as usual in a martini glass with a lime wedge (instead if a twist). The second Cosmo came with a lime twist and crushed ice - obviously two different interpretations of a well known drink recipe. The check came to just over $100.00 plus 20% tip for two each of an appetizer, alcoholic beverage and two entrees. The meal, service and drinks were only worth about 50% of that at best. The Cosmo's were just under $10 each for WELL BRAND vodka! The well brand was at least a name brand though.....I've eaten at three of the Big Burrito Group's restaurants (Soma, Kaya, Mad Mex). They are all over priced, highly decorated with fluff food that in my opinion would not fair well in any sizable city. I've lived and dined in Paris, Atlanta, Dallas, Jacksonville, and San Francisco with visits to Boston, Chicago, New York City, Washington DC, Toronto, Sydney, Auckland, Seattle, Vancouver, and many other cities. I guess I should be grateful that a modern type of restaurant such as those owned by BBG are in Pittsburgh. However, I am still confident that the older established PGH restaurants provide a much better dining experience and value. I love new ideas but also demand high quality and value.\n", "rating": -1, "title": "Mobile review", "author": "Marc Marchioli", "source": "urbanspoon", "time": "1404835453", "id": "270900"}, {"body": "\nThis place seldom disappoints.
